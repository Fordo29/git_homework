Two takeaways I have had from the first few classes of Mod 0
1. Learn to be proactive and google any question first.
2. Get comfortable being uncomfortable.  I do not know anything yet and it seems overwhelming but if I am present and put in the effort eventually the process will become easier.

Two strategies I am committed to trying for the rest of Mod 0.
1. Try my best to avoid using the mouse as much as possible by learning all the shortcuts on the keyboard.
2. Do my best to stick to the calendar I created to effectively manage my time.  

Shoutout to all my cohorts - especially Jessica F, Seth P., Tamara D and the few others for posting questions on Slack.  Even if I did not receive the same error or did not have the same question, it is extremely helpful to read your questions and the replies and learn together. Thank you for being brave!
